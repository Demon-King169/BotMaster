# DEPRECATED

I created this repository as a way to share the tool I created for my personal use with everyone, 2 years later I've decided to archive this project because of being unable to maintain. Below are some reasons to halt this project here.

  - Discord.js was around version 12 at the time of this project, but now the Discord API has changed and so has their NPM package. The current Discord.js NPM API is way to incompatible with this dashboard.
  - I wrote this project in TypeScript but uploaded the Javascript code. I've lost the original pre-compiled TypeScript source-code hence I can't easily work on this project any more.

## What's Next?
I've started working on a new project similiar to this and plan to use newer and better technologies, frameworks, and data storing systems. The new project can be found at github.com/jub0t/cyanocitta
